This plugin is intended for use in blender 3d modeling software. With the help of this plugin, you can create a character rig animation effortlessly and in no time. It is enough just to shoot a video of your movements on a plain background, and then transfer the file to the plugin. After some time, automatically generated animation keys will appear on the timeline of your character rig. That's all.
